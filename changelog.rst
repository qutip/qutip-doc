Version 3.2.0 (Never officially released)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
------------

*Core libraries*

- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Non-Markovian solvers: Hierarchy (**Added by Neill Lambert**), Memory-Cascade, and Transfer-Tensor methods.
- **MAJOR FEATURE**: Default steady state solver now up to 100x faster using the Intel Pardiso library under the Anaconda and Intel Python distributions.
- The default Wigner function now uses a Clenshaw summation algorithm to evaluate a polynomial series that is applicable for any number of exciations (previous limitation was ~50 quanta), and is ~3x faster than before. (**Added by Denis Vasilyev**)
- Can now define a given eigen spectrum for random Hermitian and density operators. 
- The Qobj ``expm`` method now uses the equivilent SciPy routine, and performs a much faster ``exp`` operation if the matrix is diagonal.
- One can now build zero operators using the ``qzero`` function.

*Control modules*

- **MAJOR FEATURE**: CRAB algorithm added
  This is an alternative to the GRAPE algorithm, which allows for analytical control functions, which means that experimental constraints can more easily be added into optimisation.  
  See tutorial notebook for full information.


Improvements
------------
*Core libraries*

- Two-time correlation functions can now be calculated for fully time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators. (**Added by Kevin Fischer**)
- The code for the inverse-power method for the steady state solver has been simplified.
- Bloch-Redfield tensor creation is now up to an order of magnitude faster. (**Added by Johannes Feist**)
- Q.transform now works properly for arrays directly from sp_eigs (or eig).
- Q.groundstate now checks for degeneracy.
- Added ``sinm`` and ``cosm`` methods to the Qobj class.
- Added ``charge`` and ``tunneling`` operators.
- Time-dependent Cython code is now easier to read and debug.


*Control modules*

- The internal state / quantum operator data type can now be either Qobj or ndarray
  Previous only ndarray was possible. This now opens up possibility of using Qobj methods in fidelity calculations
  The attributes and functions that return these operators are now preceded by an underscore, to indicate that the data type could change depending on the configuration options. 
  In most cases these functions were for internal processing only anyway, and should have been 'private'. 
  Accessors to the properties that could be useful outside of the library have been added. These always return Qobj. If the internal operator data type is not Qobj, then there could be signicant overhead in the conversion, and so this should be avoided during pulse optimisation.
  If custom sub-classes are developed that use Qobj properties and methods (e.g. partial trace), then it is very likely that it will be more efficient to set the internal data type to Qobj.
  The internal operator data will be chosen automatically based on the size and sparsity of the dynamics generator. It can be forced by setting ``dynamics.oper_dtype = <type>``
  Note this can be done by passing ``dyn_params={'oper_dtype':<type>}`` in any of the pulseoptim functions.
